  1. Devify: The first time you run devify, it renames the generic folders to be client specific. Thereafter, it drops the current database and reinstalls the profile from scratch, also enabling the sb_dev module. 
  2. Themify: Enables livereload and uses Guard to start the livereload server for theming goodness. Disables livereload when process is exited.
